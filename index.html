            <p>My name is Brian Dam, I'm currently a student attending UC Berkeley's Boot Camp aspiring to be a software developer manager one day.
                I'm a SoCal resident turned NorCal. I moved here for two reasons: one, my girlfriend is up here, two, NorCal is much grander of a
                tech hub than SoCal is. I pride myself in being a good communicator and leader. I've always been a leader growing up; whether it be 
                through leading clans/guilds/teams in games, in group projects, or in a work environment. My prior communicative skills
                got expanded even further when I decided to pursue a degree in Communications. 
            </p>
            <p>Aside from my aspirations, I am also passionate with basketball & dance. I love following the NBA. I love how team-based basketball is.
                In SoCal, I used to ball with my friends pretty often and also participated in leagues. Although basketball is highly regarded as a sport
                that is dominated by people blessed with height, I believe it is also a sport that requires a lot of team chemistry.
                I appreciate dance because it is an art that allows people to express emotion that words can not. I used to be on collegiate dance teams,
                but it was hard to continue to devote time to. I still do follow on watching performances and I still do dance as much as I can on my own.
            </p>
            <p>In August 2018, I created a Maplestory Mobile (MSM) guild. I brought together a guild that was 50 members strong. A lot of the core members 
                are now very good friends in real life. Our guild is currently top five in the whole server and we could easily be number one if we decided 
                to devote more time to the game. This is pretty nerdy but I love how this guild came together and I love how the game introduced me to 
                people I would not have met otherwise (including my girlfriend - long distance!). I probably wouldn't be attending this bootcamp and taking 
                such huge strides towards my goals if it wasn't for this game. Anyways, Thanks for visiting!
